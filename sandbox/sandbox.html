With the popularity axis on, move candidates up or down in popularity and left or right on the political spectrum.  When off, move candidates in a 2-d political spectrum.  \n\nYee diagrams can be static, by which I mean they stay the same as you move a shape.  They basically just tell you which shape wins as you move your shape around.  You can also move the voters and get a yee diagram for them.  There is also dynamic mode, which tells you who wins if the yellow triangle were moved to that spot on the diagram.  Also, turn yee diagrams off for faster performance.  \n\nLook, it's the whole shape gang! Steven Square, Tracy Triangle, Henry Hexagon, Percival Pentagon, and last but not least, Bob.",
