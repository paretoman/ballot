	description: "[type a description for your model here. for example...]\n\nBasic Instructions:  Move the shapes and dots around and press the buttons.  \n\nThere are a few different modes. A Yee diagram shows who wins when a voter moves to a position or a candidate moves to a position.  The color at that position in the diagram says who wins.  Yee diagrams can be static, by which I mean they stay the same as you move a shape.  The position of the shape you're moving is the variable.  You can also move the voters and get a yee diagram for them.  There is also dynamic mode, which changes as you move a shape (with one exception).  Dynamic mode tells uses the position of the yellow triangle as the variable and colors in the diagram with the winner's color.  Also, turn yee diagrams off for faster performance.  \n\nLook, it's the whole shape gang! Steven Square, Tracy Triangle, Henry Hexagon, Percival Pentagon, and last but not least, Bob.",
